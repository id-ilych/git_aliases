# git_aliases

Handy git aliases I use often

# Installation

1. Open your git config (usually that's `~/.gitconfig` but you can use `git config --global --edit` to open it in editor specifyed by `$EDITOR` environment variable)
2. Paste the content of [`.gitconfig`](.gitconfig)
3. Enjoy

# What do they do?

Aliases are short so it is easier to use them therefore their names are not very descriptive.
But how do I use them if I don't understand what do they do?
That's the neat part - you'll have to discrover it by reading documenation, searching the internet, asking a friend or AI assistant.
I intentionally not going to document them so you can learn something about git's powerful features.
I hope you'll enjoy it and then come up with your own adjustments or new aliases.

Have fun! :wink:
